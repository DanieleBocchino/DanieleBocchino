<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Daniele Bocchino</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Software Engineer</h3>

<h3 align="left">About me:</h3>
- 👨‍🎓 I’m a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Milan.
- 🧠 I'm very sunny, empathetic and friendly.
- 🚀 I'm very ambistious, I possess a natural predisposition for leadership.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **AWS** and **Machine Learning**

<h3 align="left">Projects:</h3>
During university I developed a few projects. If you want you can see them here, on my GitHub
I'm so passionate about software development that I invest much of my free time in creating mobile and web applications. 

- 🧑‍💻 My non-university projects are : <br/>
          [Ciuka - Party Game](https://b-except.com/ciuka/share.html)<br/>
          [ISLab Website](https://islab.di.unimi.it/)<br/>
          [Lora Giusta - Guest House](https://lora-giusta.com/)<br/>
          
I am fascinated by data, by everything that is quantifiable and from which information can be extracted. For this reason, I oriented my master's studies toward data analysis and machine learning.
- 🔭 Actually I work on my Thesis about **Audio-Visual Attention Modeling via Reinforcement Learning**
The Aim of this thesis is to study and implement a reinforcement learning approach to the problem of audio-visual attention modeling.

Understanding the machanisms that govern human vision, with particular focus on attention allocation driven by audio-visual cues, is one of the enabling factors of a natural and efficient interaction between humans and machine.
The problem of building models of human gaze behavior has a long history rooted in computational psychology and neurobiology. 
However, in the last couple of decades the problem of predicting attention allocation a visual stimuli has started to be considered a cogent issue for computer vision and pattern recognition due to the growing number of possible applications: autonomous driving image/video compression, robotics, to name a few. In essence, the attention allocation problem can be conceived as a decision making task that an ideal observer undergoes at any given time.
In particular, the observer has to decide on which portion of the stimuli allocate attention and for how long. 
These problems can be addressed as an explicit trade-off between gathering information about specific areas (exploitation ) and collecting information about the context/environment (exploration).
